# notes from first run May 2018 - 2nd year class in computer lab - code pre-tested to ensure it ran ok

# prac 1

  Tidied up and streamlined things after this class to reduce the amount of shuffling between programs.
  
  Students took a lot longer than I thought, and definitely needed clearer instructions and prompting for the 'by hand' exercise. I added   a few prompts to the instructions.
  
  Added an instructor version of the code to prevent having to develop this (and consequent shuffling between windows) in the class.
  
  They only managed to get through Exercise 1. So I allocated Exercise 2 as homework, as well as looking at the scenarios.
  
  As this was after a PVA class, there was a question about population viability. This can be addressed through proper targeet setting,     but also care regarding the assumption that what is reserved will be adequate for the species. IE attention on the actions. 
  
# prac 2

  Students reported that exercise 2 instructions were clear and everything went fine for most people. Most had already prepared some code   for their scenarios / run it even before getting to class. 
  
  One asked about loops. These are easy, for example for the targets:
    
    targets <- seq(0.1,1.0, by=0.1)
    stackofresults <- stack()
    for (i in targets){
     p1 <- p0 %>% add_relative_targets(i)
     stackofresults <- addLayer(stackofresults, solve(p1))
    }
    plot(stackofresults)
    costsofresults <- cellStats(stackofresults*soyprofit, sum) 
    
   Most students clearly got it - including a really great description of the BLM. One issue was some wanting to plot overlaps between      rasters and got it a little wrong, so clearer instructions on that might be useful (it is in the exercise 2 already but i forgot to direct them to that). 
   
   One question about the relatively linear cost vs targets. This is apparently valid here, particularly around the 17% target level: we are using a relatively monotonous ecoregion that is still largely forested. This  is because many of the species have reasonaly wide and overlapping (*potential*) distributions. So there is a lot of 'wiggle room' for the solutions. We had missied the scenario for the portfolios which could have shown this.

# notes from second run June 2018 Lund - to phd+ with own laptops

  I'd sent instructions on that they should come with prioritizr and other packages installed and ensure they can load ok. most people had done this, some minor issues that were solved during the class ok. 
  
  Timing: 
  start 9.10am
  finished the xlsx exercise by 9.30am (i think had ~15 mins on the exercise).
  Started exercise 1 at 9.45
  after this had a 15 min break
  started exercise 2 at 10.45
  started scenarios around 11.15 - but then stopped without fully doing these. more just discussed until 11.45. then finished. 
  
  versions: there is a difference (found in exercise 2) between prior version and the current version of Prioritizr. no massive. but small differences in the cells selected and the achievement/cost. may just need to update the instructions with the new version.

# notes from 20th july - Humboldt Uni Berlin
  Really quick run through of this managed to get through to the end of Exercise 2 in 1.5 hours. 
  Notes that lpsymphony will give slightly different answers each time to the same problem (something that doesnt occur with Gurobi, to my knowledge and experience)
  Don't know why. something about the algorithms i guess.
