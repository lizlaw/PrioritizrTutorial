Intro to systematic conservation planning using prioritizr - 2x1.5hrs

_Readme
28th May 2018

This practical was developed by Elizabeth Law (workingconservation@gmail.com) while at Humboldt Universität zu Berlin) with much help from Florian Pötzschner (Humboldt Universität zu Berlin), and pilfering from the Prioritizr documentation (with permission from Jeffrey Hanson and Richard Schuster, thanks both!!). The course, like the Prioritizr software itself, represents the new generation of ‘Marxan’ conservation planning software. As such, much of the overall structure of the course are also inspired by the Marxan resources.

It was designed as a practical to be run over 2 sessions, each 1.5 hours, with a week in between, for a 2-3rd yr Conservation course coordinated by Tobias Kümmerle, in the department of Geography, Humboldt Universität zu Berlin. Students are expected to have some basis in GIS especially rasters (mostly via ArcGIS however). Not all have experience with R.

Full course materials include:
 - input data folder 
 - rmarkdown files folder (containing both the .rmd and the knitted .html files)
 - PrioritizrPlanning_NADC.pptx
 - Systematic Conservation Prioritization.docx
 - Systematic Conservation Prioritization.pdf (pdf of the above)
 
However, not all of these should be provided to the students. The students only need the .pdf version of the instructions (which echos the .pptx), the .html versions of the exercise instructions, and the input data folder.

The folder also includes, for the purposes of course development, R-markdown .rmd files, and .docx versions of the instructions, and the .pptx for presentation during the class. There is also the Exercise_1_instructor file.r which just contains all the code for exercise 1 so the instructor doesn’t have to switch between screens and copy manually. Similarly for Exercise_2.

The data are coarsely aggregated from data used in an in preparation manuscript by Elizabeth Law, Leandro Macchi, Tobias Kümmerle, and their co-authors. We hope to have the full manuscript with methodology details published by the end of 2018 / early 2019. For the purpose of this exercise, units and other such methodological details should not be required.

As this course was being prepared, Prioritizr was being developed to also have functionality to include multiple ‘zones’ or land use types. Therefore, some of the references, calls, versions, etc. may be different in the future. We also hope to have a zone analysis practical in the future as well 

We hope you enjoy!
